## Abstract
A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the phys-
ical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations
of a swarmâ€™s normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the
likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment.
During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used
by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antag-
onistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of
antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data
of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the
anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion cor-
rectly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining
a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally,
the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to
the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both
the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the
detection criterion are increased.
